# employee-tracker

## Description
I built a node application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, MySQL, and more (listed in the Technologies section). This Content Management System (CMS) application allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Usage
* Run node index.js to begin.
* Choose the appropriate option from the dropdown
* View departments, roles, and employees
* Add departments, roles, and employees
* Update employee roles
* Select 'Exit' when complete
