# employee-tracker
I built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This Content Management System (CMS) application allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line:

I designed the database schema as shown in the following image:
